# Mobile App Automation Testing for Myntra

Appium + Python automation framework for testing the Myntra Android application on an emulator.

## Project goals

- Launch the Myntra app and reach the home screen (dismiss onboarding with Back).
- Search for products (e.g. shoes), apply filters and sort, open a product and add it to the bag.
- Change quantity in the bag, proceed to Place Order, handle the login prompt if it appears, then empty the cart and return to home.
- Use explicit waits, clear logging, and reusable helpers (no coordinate hacks where avoidable).

## Main automation flow (end-to-end script)

The script **`scripts/open_myntra_home.py`** runs a full user journey in human terms:

1. **Launch** – Start the Myntra app and create the Appium session.

2. **Reach home** – Wait for the first screen (splash/onboarding) to show, then press Back once so the app goes to the home screen instead of exiting. No extra Back presses so the app does not close.

3. **Search** – Go to the search bar, type **shoes**, and submit. If the profile screen opens in between, it presses Back once and continues. Search uses short timeouts and several locators so the bar is found quickly.

4. **Results and filters** – On the shoes listing, it selects **Gender → Male**, opens **Sort**, chooses **Discounts**, then opens the **first shoe** in the list (tap in the product area so it does not hit banners or filters).

5. **Product and add to bag** – On the product page it taps **Add to bag**. When the size pop-up appears it picks the first available size from 5–10 and taps **DONE**.

6. **Bag and quantity** – It goes back to home, opens the **bag** from the bottom navigation, sets **quantity to 2** via the quantity dropdown and confirms with **DONE**. Then it taps **Place Order** by tapping at the bottom of the screen first (where the button always is), so there is no page scroll or long wait. If that tap does not work, it tries to find the Place Order button by locators and clicks it.

7. **Login prompt** – If a login screen appears after Place Order, the script closes it (X or top-right tap) and returns to the home screen.

8. **Empty cart** – It opens the bag again. On the Shopping Bag screen it finds the product card (using “Qty” or “Size” to know where the card is) and taps the **X** at the top-right of that card. When the confirmation popup appears (**Cancel** and **REMOVE**), it taps **REMOVE** (by finding the button or by tapping the right side of the dialog). It then waits **2 seconds** in the cart before pressing Back until the Home tab is visible.

9. **Finish** – The app stays open for **5 seconds** (or until you press Ctrl+C if you use `--stay`), then the driver quits.

**Search results** – The script checks that the results page has loaded by looking for the **SORT** or **GENDER** buttons on the listing (they appear on the shoes page), then falls back to recycler/result locators if needed. This makes “Search results loaded” show correctly even when the app uses different IDs.

**First product** – It tries to open the first shoe by **clicking the product element** (so the page does not scroll by mistake). If that fails, it uses a tap in the product area with a click-style gesture.

All of this uses **explicit waits** and **element-based** actions where possible. A small helper is used for taps that must be by position (e.g. the card X and the REMOVE button), using Appium’s mobile gesture or W3C actions so taps register reliably. Waits and timeouts have been tuned so the flow runs faster without skipping steps.

## How to run the main script

From the project root with the virtual environment activated:

```bash
# Full flow, then app stays open 5 seconds and closes
python scripts/open_myntra_home.py

# Keep the app open until you press Ctrl+C
python scripts/open_myntra_home.py --stay

# Skip selecting Gender = Male on the shoes page
python scripts/open_myntra_home.py --no-male
```

**Before running:** Start the Appium server (`appium`) and have the Android emulator running with the Myntra app installed.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.10+** and a virtual environment.
2. **Android Studio** – SDK and emulator.
3. **Appium** – e.g. `npm install -g appium`.
4. **UiAutomator2** – `appium driver install uiautomator2`.
5. **ADB** – from Android SDK.
6. **Myntra app** – installed on the emulator (Play Store or APK).

## Setup

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
# or: venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the emulator, install Myntra, then start Appium: `appium`.

## Configuration

- **App package and activity** – Set in `config/capabilities.py`. To see the current activity when Myntra is open:  
  `adb shell dumpsys window | grep -E 'mCurrentFocus'`
- **Locators** – Adjust `pages/locators.py` after inspecting the app in Appium Inspector (search bar, bag icon, product card X, REMOVE button, etc.).

## Running tests (pytest)

```bash
pytest
pytest --html=reports/report.html --self-contained-html
pytest tests/test_app_launch.py -v
pytest -v -s
```

## Test scenarios covered

| Test            | Description                          |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------|
| App launch      | App starts and home loads            |
| Onboarding      | Login/skip dialogs handled           |
| Home screen     | Search icon and navigation           |
| Search flow     | Tap search, enter "shoes", results   |
| Product details | Open product, details page          |
| Add to bag      | Select size, add item, bag          |
| Bag operations  | Remove item, quantity, checkout     |
| Navigation      | Scroll, transitions, popups         |

## Recent updates

- **Place Order** – Tap at the bottom of the cart screen first so the button is clicked right away, with no scroll and no long wait. If the tap fails, the script falls back to finding the button by locators.
- **Keep-open time** – Reduced to 5 seconds at the end of the run (was 15 seconds).
- **Search results check** – Listing page is detected by SORT and GENDER buttons first, so “Search results loaded” appears correctly even when the app uses different result IDs.
- **First shoe** – Prefer clicking the product element so the page does not scroll; use a click-style tap only if needed.
- **Empty cart** – After tapping REMOVE in the confirmation popup, the script waits 2 seconds in the cart before going back to home.
- **Timing** – Waits and timeouts across the flow were reduced so the full run finishes sooner while still being stable.

## Notes

- **Locators** – Myntra may use custom IDs; update `pages/locators.py` with Appium Inspector.
- **Emulator** – Fully boot before running the script or tests.
- **Appium** – Must be running before execution.
- **Logs** – Written under `reports/` (e.g. `automation_YYYYMMDD.log`).

## Tools and technologies

- **Appium** – Mobile automation
- **UiAutomator2** – Android driver
- **Python** – Script and tests
- **pytest** – Test runner
- **Appium Python Client** – Appium bindings
